"""
E2E tests for AI Gateway.

These tests run LOCALLY and require Docker to be running.
They test the full system integration in isolated temporary environments.

IMPORTANT: E2E tests are designed to run on local development machines,
NOT on production servers. Production servers are used only for monitoring
and information gathering, not for running tests.

See docs/getting-started.md for system requirements.
See IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md#Этап-6 for E2E test requirements.
