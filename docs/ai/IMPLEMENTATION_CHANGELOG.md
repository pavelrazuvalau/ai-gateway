## 🤖 Instructions for AI agent

**Important:** This section is part of the template (View layer). When creating actual artifacts (Model layer), **COPY this instruction section** into the artifact at the end of the document. This ensures that instructions for working with the artifact are always available within the artifact itself, making it self-sufficient and independent of external prompts or templates.

**Artifact System Overview:**

This artifact is part of a system of 4 required artifacts that work together:

1. **PLAN** (`*_PLAN.md`) - Execution roadmap with phases and steps. Contains current status, blockers references, and navigation.
2. **CHANGELOG** (`*_CHANGELOG.md`) - History of completed changes. Contains chronological entries with what, why, and results.
3. **QUESTIONS** (`*_QUESTIONS.md`) - Knowledge base for doubts and solutions. Contains active questions (blockers) and resolved questions.
4. **SESSION_CONTEXT** (`*_SESSION_CONTEXT.md`) - Current work state. Contains temporary notes, intermediate decisions, and active context.

**Artifact Relationships:**
- PLAN references blockers in QUESTIONS and recent changes in CHANGELOG
- CHANGELOG entries link to PLAN steps and related questions in QUESTIONS
- QUESTIONS link to PLAN steps and CHANGELOG entries where solutions were applied
- SESSION_CONTEXT tracks current PLAN phase/step and active questions

**When to update artifacts:**
- **PLAN**: When step status changes, when starting/completing steps, when blocked
- **CHANGELOG**: When step completes, when question is resolved, when approach changes
- **QUESTIONS**: When creating new question, when answering question
- **SESSION_CONTEXT**: When starting step, when discovering blocker, when completing step, when making intermediate decisions

**How to read artifacts (created from this template):**
1. Entries are sorted by date (newest first, chronological order)
2. Each entry contains: Description, Changes, Why this solution, Result
3. Use index by phases/steps for quick search
4. Check links to related questions in entries
5. Entry types: ✅ Completed, ❌ Stopped, 🔧 Approach Changed

**How to update artifacts (created from this template):**
1. When step completes → add new entry at the top (after metadata):
   - Add entry immediately after metadata section
   - Use format: `## YYYY-MM-DD - Phase X, Step X.Y`
   - Include all required sections (see "Entry Format" section above)
2. Entry format: `## YYYY-MM-DD - Phase X, Step X.Y`
   - Date format: YYYY-MM-DD
   - Phase/Step reference: Phase X, Step X.Y
3. Required sections for ✅ Completed entries:
   - Description (brief summary)
   - Changes (specific files with changes)
   - Why this solution (explanation with alternatives considered)
   - Result (measurable/verifiable outcomes)
   - Related (links to questions if any)
4. Entry types:
   - ✅ Completed: Step completed successfully
   - ❌ Stopped: Work stopped due to blocker (include reason, question link)
   - 🔧 Approach Changed: Initial approach changed (include original plan, why changed, new approach)
5. Add links to related questions (if any):
   - Format: `QX.Y in @*_QUESTIONS.md`
6. Update index by phases/steps:
   - Add entry to index section
   - Format: `- Step X.Y: [Name] (line ~N)`

**Formatting rules:**
- Use exact entry format as defined in "Entry Format" section above
- Date format: YYYY-MM-DD
- File paths in Changes section: use backticks `file.[ext]`
- Links use `@[ARTIFACT_NAME]` notation
- Entry types use icons: ✅ ❌ 🔧

**When to use this file:**
- When checking history of completed changes
- When understanding decision rationale
- When searching for examples of completed steps
- When checking related questions
- When documenting completed work

**Related artifacts:**
- `*_PLAN.md` - for understanding current state and next steps
- `*_QUESTIONS.md` - for checking active questions mentioned in entries
- `*_SESSION_CONTEXT.md` - for current session context
