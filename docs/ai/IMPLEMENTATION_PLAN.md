## 📐 Formatting Reference

This section defines all formatting rules, icons, and structure for PLAN artifacts. Use these definitions when creating or updating PLAN artifacts.

### Status Icons

**For PLAN artifact (overall status in Metadata section):**
- 🟡 **IN PROGRESS** - Plan is active and ready for execution (default when plan is created and ready)
- 🔴 **BLOCKED** - Plan execution blocked by unresolved question (at least one step is BLOCKED)
- 🟢 **COMPLETED** - All steps completed
- ⚪ **PENDING** - Plan creation not complete or prerequisites not met (rarely used)

**For Steps and Phases:**
- ⚪ **PENDING** / **Pending** - Future step, not yet reached in workflow (prerequisites not met, previous steps not completed)
- 🔵 **READY FOR WORK** / **Ready for Work** - Next step, prerequisites met, ready to start work (previous step completed)
- 🟡 **IN PROGRESS** / **In Progress** - Actively working on this step, completion criteria are being worked on
- 🔴 **BLOCKED** / **Blocked** - Cannot proceed due to blocking issue, question created in QUESTIONS, waiting for resolution
- 🟢 **COMPLETED** / **Done** - All completion criteria met, changes documented in CHANGELOG

**Key clarification:**
- When plan is created and ready → PLAN status = 🟡 IN PROGRESS (not PENDING!)
- When step is next and ready to start → Step status = 🔵 READY FOR WORK (not PENDING!)
- When cannot proceed (any blocker) → Step status = 🔴 BLOCKED (not PENDING or READY FOR WORK!)
- ⚪ PENDING for steps means "future step, prerequisites not met", NOT "ready to work"
- 🔵 READY FOR WORK for steps means "next step, can start immediately"
- First step of a new plan should be 🔵 READY FOR WORK (plan is ready, first step can start)

**Types of blockers (all result in 🔴 BLOCKED):**
- Waiting for question answer (question in QUESTIONS artifact)
- Waiting for user decision/approval
- External dependency not available
- Technical issue blocking progress
- Missing information that requires clarification

**Status transition rules:**
- ⚪ PENDING → 🔵 READY FOR WORK (when prerequisites met, previous step completed)
- 🔵 READY FOR WORK → 🟡 IN PROGRESS (when work begins on next step)
- 🟡 IN PROGRESS → 🟢 COMPLETED (when all criteria met) + next step: PENDING → READY FOR WORK
- 🟡 IN PROGRESS → 🔴 BLOCKED (when blocker discovered)
- 🔴 BLOCKED → 🟡 IN PROGRESS (when question answered)

**For Questions:**
- ⏳ **Pending** - Question created, waiting for answer
- ✅ **Resolved** - Question answered, solution documented, moved to resolved section

### Priority Icons (for questions)

- 🔴 **High** - Blocks work, cannot proceed
- 🟡 **Medium** - Affects work, can proceed with assumptions
- 🟢 **Low** - Optimization, can proceed without answer

**Priority sorting:** Questions must be sorted by priority: 🔴 High → 🟡 Medium → 🟢 Low

### Blocker Type Icons (for questions)

- 🔍 **Requires user clarification** - needs clarification of context or requirements
- 🏗️ **Architectural problem** - design contradiction
- 🐛 **Bug discovered** - technical blocker
- 📊 **Requirements unclear** - needs clarification of business logic
- 🤔 **Requires deeper analysis** - model is uncertain and risks hallucinating an answer; needs more thorough investigation or user confirmation

### Structure Formatting

**Metadata section:**
- Must include: Artifact Version, Last Adaptation Date, Purpose, Status, Current Phase, Current Step, Last Update
- Status values: 🟢 COMPLETED | 🟡 IN PROGRESS | 🔴 BLOCKED | 🔵 READY FOR WORK | ⚪ PENDING

**Phase structure:**
- Format: `### Phase X: [Phase Name]`
- Must include: Context, Goal, Status
- Status uses same icons as steps

**Step structure:**
- Format: `#### Step X.Y: [Step Name]`
- Must include sections:
  - Status (with icon)
  - What needs to be done (bullet list)
  - Where to make changes (bullet list with files/functions)
  - Why this approach (paragraph)
  - How (numbered list of actions)
  - IMPACT (bullet list of measurable results)
  - Completion criteria (checklist)
  - Related questions: QX.Y in @*_QUESTIONS.md (include only if question exists for this step)

### Cross-Artifact Links

**Link format:** `@[ARTIFACT_NAME]` notation

**Examples:**
- `@[TASK_NAME]_PLAN.md` - link to PLAN
- `@[TASK_NAME]_CHANGELOG.md (Phase 1, Step 1.1)` - link to specific entry
- `QX.Y in @[TASK_NAME]_QUESTIONS.md` - link to question

**Rules:**
- Always use artifact file name
- Include phase/step or question identifier when linking to specific content
- Use consistent format across all artifacts
- Verify links point to existing content

### Anchor Links for Navigation

**Concept**: Anchor links provide fast navigation for both AI agents and humans. They enable quick jumping to specific sections within artifacts.

**Format**: `[Text](#anchor-name)` where anchor is generated from heading text.

**Anchor Generation Rules**:
- Markdown automatically creates anchors from headings
- Format: lowercase, spaces converted to hyphens, special characters removed
- Example: `#### Step 4.3: E2E Tests` → anchor `#step-43-e2e-tests`
- For headings with special characters, use the exact heading text and let Markdown generate the anchor

**Usage**:
- Use anchor links in "Current Focus" and "Quick Navigation" sections
- Update anchor links when current step/question changes
- Anchor links enable both agents and humans to quickly navigate to relevant sections

**Example**:
- In PLAN artifact "Current Focus" section: `[Phase 1, Step 1.1: Setup](#phase-1-step-11-setup)`
- In QUESTIONS artifact "Current Focus" section: `[Q2.1: Question Title](#q21-question-title-phase-2-step-1)`

**Important**: Always verify anchor links point to existing headings in the artifact.

## 🤖 Instructions for AI agent

**Important:** This section is part of the template (View layer). When creating actual artifacts (Model layer), **COPY this instruction section** into the artifact at the end of the document. This ensures that instructions for working with the artifact are always available within the artifact itself, making it self-sufficient and independent of external prompts or templates.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT FOR CREATION AGENT (planning agent):**

These instructions are for FUTURE USE by the execution agent.
DO NOT try to execute these instructions while creating the artifact.
Your job is to COPY this entire section into the artifact as-is, at the end of the document.
These instructions will be used later when working with the artifact during execution phase.
Do NOT follow "How to update" or "When to update" instructions during artifact creation.

**Contract Definition:**
- This template defines the contract for working with artifacts
- Template (View layer) = Structure and formatting rules
- Artifact (Model layer) = Data + Copied instructions (self-sufficient)
- Instructions in this section define how to work with artifacts
- Model follows contract: uses artifacts according to instructions, generates responses in expected format

**Artifact System Overview:**

This artifact is part of a system of 4 required artifacts that work together:

1. **PLAN** (`*_PLAN.md`) - Execution roadmap with phases and steps. Contains current status, blockers references, and navigation.
2. **CHANGELOG** (`*_CHANGELOG.md`) - History of completed changes. Contains chronological entries with what, why, and results.
3. **QUESTIONS** (`*_QUESTIONS.md`) - Repository for doubts and solutions. Contains active questions (blockers) and resolved questions.
4. **SESSION_CONTEXT** (`*_SESSION_CONTEXT.md`) - Current work state. Contains temporary notes, intermediate decisions, and active context.

**Artifact Relationships:**
- PLAN references blockers in QUESTIONS and recent changes in CHANGELOG
- CHANGELOG entries link to PLAN steps and related questions in QUESTIONS
- QUESTIONS link to PLAN steps and CHANGELOG entries where solutions were applied
- SESSION_CONTEXT tracks current PLAN phase/step and active questions

**Execution:**

**CRITICAL:** Work step-by-step with stops after each step/phase. Wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding to the next step.

**Step-by-Step Execution:**
- Stop after each step/phase
- Wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding to the next step
- Provide clear final results and indicate next step from PLAN
- Update PLAN metadata after each step completion

**When to update artifacts:**
- **PLAN**: When step status changes, when starting/completing steps, when blocked
- **CHANGELOG**: When step completes, when question is resolved, when approach changes
- **QUESTIONS**: When creating new question, when answering question
- **SESSION_CONTEXT**: When starting step, when discovering blocker, when completing step, when making intermediate decisions

**How to read artifacts (created from this template):**
1. Start with section "🚦 Quick Navigation for AI agent" to understand current state (blockers are referenced here)
2. Study current step in section "Implementation Phases"
3. Follow the instructions in this section for working with the artifact

**How to update artifacts (created from this template):**
1. When step status changes → update metadata at the beginning of file:
   - Update "Status" field
   - Update "Current Phase" and "Current Step" if changed
   - Update "Last Update" date
   - **Update "🎯 Current Focus" section** with new step link and status
2. When step completes → update step status (🟢 Done) and metadata:
   - Change step status to 🟢 Done
   - Update phase status if all steps complete
   - Update metadata fields
   - **Update "🎯 Current Focus" section**: If next step exists → show next step with status, if all steps completed → show "All steps completed"
3. When blocked → update status (🔴 Blocked) and add blocker reference:
   - Change step status to 🔴 Blocked
   - Update phase status to 🔴 BLOCKED (if this is the first blocked step in the phase, or if phase status is not already BLOCKED)
   - Add blocker reference to "🚦 Quick Navigation for AI agent" section
   - Update metadata
   - **Update "🎯 Current Focus" section** with blocked status and set "Action Required: [specific action]" if needs user input (e.g., "Answer question in @*_QUESTIONS.md (QX.Y)")
4. When starting work → update status to 🟡 In Progress:
   - Change step status from ⚪ Pending to 🟡 In Progress
   - Update metadata
   - **Update "🎯 Current Focus" section** with In Progress status
5. After changes → add entry to `*_CHANGELOG.md` (see CHANGELOG artifact instructions for procedure)

**How to update Current Focus section:**

**Simple rule:** Show the highest priority active step (first step that is not completed).

**Procedure:**
1. Find the first step with status: 🟡 IN PROGRESS, 🔴 BLOCKED, 🔵 READY FOR WORK, or ⚪ PENDING (in order of phases and steps)
2. Update "🎯 Current Focus" section with that step's link and status
3. If step is BLOCKED and needs user input → set "Action Required: [specific action]" (e.g., "Answer question in @*_QUESTIONS.md (QX.Y)")
4. If all steps completed → show "All steps completed"

**Examples:**

**Example 1: Step in progress**
```
## 🎯 Current Focus

> **Current Step:** [Phase 1, Step 1.1: Setup environment](#phase-1-step-11-setup-environment)
> **Status:** 🟡 IN PROGRESS
> **Action Required:** No action required
```

**Example 2: Step blocked**
```
## 🎯 Current Focus

> **Current Step:** [Phase 2, Step 2.3: Implement feature](#phase-2-step-23-implement-feature)
> **Status:** 🔴 BLOCKED
> **Action Required:** Answer question in @*_QUESTIONS.md (Q2.3)
```

**Example 3: All completed**
```
## 🎯 Current Focus

> **Status:** All steps completed
```

**Anchor link format:** `[Phase X, Step Y: Step Name](#phase-x-step-xy-step-name)` (Markdown auto-creates anchors from headings)
   - Example: `#### Step 4.3: E2E Tests` → `#step-43-e2e-tests`
   - For steps with special characters, use the exact heading text and let Markdown generate the anchor
   - To find the correct anchor, look at the actual heading in the document and use the format shown above

**Formatting rules:**
- Use exact status icons as defined in "📐 Formatting Reference" section above
- Follow structure: Phase → Step → What/Where/Why/How/IMPACT/Completion criteria
- Use consistent phase/step numbering (Phase X, Step X.Y)
- Links to other artifacts use `@[ARTIFACT_NAME]` notation
- Metadata fields must be updated when status changes

**Technical Update Procedures:**

When updating this artifact, especially for long lists of phases and steps, follow these technical procedures:

1. **Determine if list is "long":**
   - Count elements: more than 3-5 phases OR more than 3-5 steps within a phase
   - Estimate content size: more than 50-100 lines of content for all phases/steps OR more than 3-5 KB of data
   - If matches ANY of these criteria → use sequential filling

2. **Sequential filling for PLAN:**
   - **Phases:** Create phases one at a time (one phase per iteration) via `search_replace`
   - **Steps:** Within each phase, create steps one at a time (one step per iteration) via `search_replace`
   - **MANDATORY:** After each phase/step, verify success via `read_file`
   - Example: If plan contains 3 phases with 5 steps each → create phase 1, verify, create steps of phase 1 (one by one), verify each step, then proceed to phase 2

3. **Success verification after each element:**
   - `read_file` to verify file exists
   - Verify that file is not empty
   - Verify that element was added correctly (file contains the new phase/step, structure is preserved)
   - If verification fails → retry with the same element (maximum 1-2 times)
   - If after 1-2 attempts element not added → continue with next element (do not block entire process)

**For detailed information:** See "Sequential Content Filling for Long Lists" section in system prompt (planning agent or execution agent) or PROMPT_ENGINEERING_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md

**Plan Compliance Check:**

**When to conduct compliance check:**
- When creating a new plan
- When updating an existing plan
- When adding new phases/steps
- Periodically (when reference documentation is significantly updated)

**What to check (universal - always applicable):**
- Presence of all structure elements (What, Where, Why, How, Impact)
- Completeness and clarity of step descriptions
- Consistency of terminology and formatting

**What to check (if reference documentation is available):**
- Alignment of tasks with latest reference documentation updates
- Accuracy of links to reference documentation sections
- Compliance with documented best practices and concepts

**Procedure for compliance check:**
1. **Check step structure (always):**
   - Verify each step contains all required fields: What, Where, Why, How, Impact
   - Use file reading tool to analyze plan structure
   - Identify steps missing required fields

2. **Check alignment with reference sources (if available):**
   - If MCP servers with business context are available: Use MCP resources tool to check alignment with business requirements
   - If user context is available: Verify alignment with user-provided requirements
   - Compare plan tasks with proven practices from available sources
   - Identify discrepancies or outdated approaches

3. **Check link accuracy (if reference documentation is available):**
   - Use exact search tool to verify links to reference sections exist
   - Use file reading tool to verify linked sections are current
   - Identify broken or outdated links

4. **Check concept compliance (if reference documentation is available):**
   - Verify plan follows documented concepts and best practices
   - Verify plan uses universal formulations (not project-specific)
   - Verify plan follows agent-agnostic principles

5. **Create compliance report:**
   - Summary of check (status, number of steps checked)
   - Critical issues (if any)
   - Important notes (if any)
   - Recommendations for fixes

6. **Fix non-compliance:**
   - Fix identified issues in the plan
   - Add missing fields (Impact, Why if missing)
   - Update outdated links (if applicable)
   - Align with available best practices
   - Or add to plan as tasks if fixes require significant work

**Success criteria:**
- All steps contain complete structure (What, Where, Why, How, Impact)
- All links to reference documentation are accurate (if applicable)
- Tasks align with proven practices from available sources (if applicable)
- Concepts comply with documented best practices (if applicable)

**Compliance report format:**
- Summary of check (status, number of steps checked)
- Critical issues (if any)
- Important notes (if any)
- Recommendations for fixes

**Examples of correct step structure with IMPACT:**

```markdown
#### Step X.Y: [Step Name]
